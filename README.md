# Baby Name Analyzer
A simple program that analyzes US baby name csv data from 1880 to 2014 and reports related statistics. The program
takes your name, birth gender, and birth year as an input, and then uses that information to provide you with interesting
facts about the popularity of your name throughout the years you're interested in.

This mini project was built when I just started learning java. My motivation was to learn more about parsing and working
with data.
